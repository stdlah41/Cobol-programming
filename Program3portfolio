Portfolio of program 3.
	First day. Came in, started on a diagram of what I wanted the program to look like. 
Posted online to see if anyone wanted to get together for this project. No responses.

Second day. Started the beginning portion of my program. Searched for some clues on how an extendable has would work in this type of environment.  Set up my FD area to match up with how the input that was expected to come in would look like.  Set up my outputs like the example on blackboard.

	Asked in class if people wanted to get together, they said yes but  the piazza is still empty.Decided to make 1 big program since linkage is not my forte .  Go home early due to being really stuck.
	
	Fourth day. Class day. Professor goes over extended has and I understand it but cant quite wrap it all together. Don’t want to copy it straight out but if I cant understand it 100%..... theres just so much.
Added in the creation of the external hash table pretty closely resembling professors.  I do hope I can figure out linkage enough to  coble together the b+tree he allows us to use since I don’t have a partner.
