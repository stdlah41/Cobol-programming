Instructions for this....

I know these programs suck.. im sorry for that but the fact that I got this github thing to work should add some points!!!
Ive spent hours getting git hub to do what I want and didnt have a partner.

Program 3 is meant for program 3.

Program A is ... Program A

Inversion is meant to link into Program A but i dont know how to link so ...theres that.

Phonebooth is because I dont know how to delete an empty file.

and lastly i had to send my portfolio's somehow.



I couldnt find a way to make this program take my files a cbl or txt so i had to
create multiple files and edit those then upload them. Took forever to figure out... hope i can pass this class.
